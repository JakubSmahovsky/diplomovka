The original attack on the protocol requires compromising Kab2.
This is not yet possible in our language.

The attacker can still replay m3 instead of m4, this attack is found
by the authentication query, but the adversary does not learn Na, so
it doesn't know the fake Kab2.

We can compromise Na after the protocol and we should find an attack
against the confidentiality of Kab2. Unfortunately, Tamarin-Prover
doesn't terminate in this analysis.
